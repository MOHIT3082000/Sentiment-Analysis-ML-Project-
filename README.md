# Sentiment-Analysis-ML-Project-
Sentiment Analysis with RNN 🚀 A deep learning-based Sentiment Analysis app that classifies text as positive or negative using an RNN (LSTM/GRU). It features tokenization, sequence padding, and a Streamlit UI for real-time predictions. Built with TensorFlow, NLP, Pandas, and Python, the model is saved in .h5 for easy deployment. 🚀
Sentiment Analysis Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) 🚀
Overview
This project is a Sentiment Analysis application that classifies text as positive or negative using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model leverages deep learning techniques to understand and predict sentiment based on natural language processing (NLP).

The project includes a Streamlit-based UI, making it easy to input text and receive real-time sentiment predictions.

Key Features
